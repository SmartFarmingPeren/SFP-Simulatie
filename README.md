## Simulation
For the simulation code go to the simulation branch
Follow the readme to install the code. You need 2 computers capable of making a network connection. One to run the unity simulation side and one to run ROS neotic.
We recommend a PC and a laptop with either one having ubuntu 20.04 installed as a dual boot.
